# portfolio_bot

The RePort Bot scrapes textual content from ePortfolio pages and automatically returns analyis of these pages that coheres around the concept of "rhetorical velocity." 

This repository hosts working code and sample outputs. However, this code is tailored to scrape content from the site [ryan-omizo.com](https://ryan-omizo.com). CSS and XPath selectors will vary across ePortfolios, so the links to [ryan-omizo.com](https://ryan-omizo.com) found in the RePort Bot spider and the `div` selectors used in ePortfolio.py will need to modified for use on other sites.
